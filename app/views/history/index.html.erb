  <h2>The History of BPMF (Zhuyin)</h2>
  
  <div class="lesson-content">
    <p>
      BPMF, also known as <strong>Zhuyin</strong> (注音) or <strong>Bopomofo</strong>, is a phonetic system used to transcribe Chinese characters, particularly in Taiwan. The name "Bopomofo" comes from the first four symbols: ㄅ (b), ㄆ (p), ㄇ (m), and ㄈ (f).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Origins (1913-1918)</h3>
    <p>
      BPMF was created by the <strong>Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation</strong> (讀音統一會) during the early Republic of China period. The system was introduced by the Beiyang government in 1913 and officially promulgated in 1918.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symbols were derived from ancient Chinese characters, specifically from oracle bone script, seal script, and clerical script. Each symbol was carefully designed to represent a specific sound in Mandarin Chinese.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Development and Adoption</h3>
    <p>
      Initially used in China from 1918 to 1958, BPMF was later replaced by Hanyu Pinyin in China. However, it continued to be used in Taiwan, where it remains the primary phonetic system for teaching Chinese characters to children.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Taiwan, BPMF has been the standard phonetic system since 1945 and is still widely used today in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Elementary school education</li>
      <li>Chinese dictionaries</li>
      <li>Computer input methods</li>
      <li>Language learning materials</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Complete System</h3>
    <p>
      BPMF consists of <strong>37 symbols</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>21 Initials (聲母)</strong>: Consonants that begin syllables (ㄅ, ㄆ, ㄇ, ㄈ, ㄉ, ㄊ, ㄋ, ㄌ, ㄍ, ㄎ, ㄏ, ㄐ, ㄑ, ㄒ, ㄓ, ㄔ, ㄕ, ㄖ, ㄗ, ㄘ, ㄙ)</li>
      <li><strong>16 Finals (韻母)</strong>: Vowels and vowel combinations that end syllables (ㄚ, ㄛ, ㄜ, ㄝ, ㄞ, ㄟ, ㄠ, ㄡ, ㄢ, ㄣ, ㄤ, ㄥ, ㄦ, ㄧ, ㄨ, ㄩ)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Modern Usage</h3>
    <p>
      Today, BPMF is primarily used in Taiwan for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Teaching children to read and write Chinese characters</li>
      <li>Providing pronunciation guides in dictionaries</li>
      <li>Computer input methods (Zhuyin input method)</li>
      <li>Language learning applications and games (like this one!)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Technical Aspects</h3>
    <p>
      BPMF symbols are part of the Unicode standard and are supported in modern computer systems. The system is written:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Left-to-right (horizontally)</li>
      <li>Top-to-bottom (vertically)</li>
      <li>Alongside Chinese characters as ruby text (small annotations above or beside characters)</li>
    </ul>
